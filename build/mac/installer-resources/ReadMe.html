<p>Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and performance management.</p>

<p>PCP provides a unifying abstraction for all of the interesting
performance data in a system, and allows client applications to
easily retrieve and process any subset of that data using a single
API.</p>

<p>A client-server architecture allows multiple clients to monitor the
same host, and a single client to monitor multiple hosts (e.g. in a
cluster).  This enables centralized monitoring of distributed
processing.</p>

<p>Integrated archive logging and replay so a client application can use
the same API to process real-time data from a host or historical data
from an archive.</p>

<p>The architecture and services of the base PCP infrastructure are
especially attractive for those tackling the harder system-level
performance problems.  For example this may involve a transient
performance degradation, or some complex interaction between resource
demands on a single system, or those seeking centralized monitoring of
distributed processing (e.g. in a cluster or webserver farm
environment), or management of performance on large systems with lots
of moving parts.</p>

<p>The open source release of PCP includes all of the PCP libraries,
infrastructure and daemons, along with a Darwin agent that exports a
broad range of performance data from 7.4.x (Mac OS X 10.4) onward.
This includes coverage of activity in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CPU 
    <li>Disk 
    <li>Memory 
    <li>Swapping 
    <li>Network 
    <li>NFS 
    <li>RPC 
    <li>Filesystems 
</ul>
<p>Other agents export performance data from: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Apache
    <li>Cisco routers 
    <li>Databases
    <li>ElasticSearch 
    <li>Postfix
    <li>Samba
    <li>Web server activity logs 
    <li>... and many more places.
</ul>
