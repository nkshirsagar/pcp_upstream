# Local rule to build a container tarball.tgz from a Dockerfile.
#
# To avoid having to run the docker commands as root, you can run the docker
# daemon with -G groupname  where groupname is a group you're in. Edit
# /etc/sysconfig/docker (or equiv for your distro) and set the OPTIONS variable
# e.g. OPTIONS="-G wheel", then restart the docker service. This allows users
# in group e.g. 'wheel' access to the local docker unix domain socket interface.
