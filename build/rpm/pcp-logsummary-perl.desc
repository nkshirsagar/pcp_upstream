The PCP::LogSummary module provides a Perl module for using the
statistical summary data produced by the Performance Co-Pilot
pmlogsummary utility.  This utility produces various averages,
minima, maxima, and other calculations based on the performance
data stored in a PCP archive.  The Perl interface is ideal for
exporting this data into third-party tools (e.g. spreadsheets).
