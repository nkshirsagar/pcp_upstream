The PCP::MMV module contains the Perl language bindings for
building scripts instrumented with the Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) Memory Mapped Value (MMV) mechanism.
This mechanism allows arbitrary values to be exported from an
instrumented script into the PCP infrastructure for monitoring
and analysis with pmchart, pmie, pmlogger and other PCP tools.
