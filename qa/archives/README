QA archives that are static.

These ones are checked into the git tree.

For some of them, the makefile and the associated pmlogger configuration
files and scripts provide recipes for recreating them.

Others come from sources that are not reproducible, e.g. users reporting
bugs.

See also ../tmparch for the dynamically recreated QA archives.
