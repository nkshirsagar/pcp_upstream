be evaluated, as a subset of configured network interfaces.  Each
network interface should be enclosed in single quotes, prefixed by a
pound or hash (#) and multiple entries separated by white space,
e.g.  #'ec0' #'ec2'
To discover the names of the network interfaces, execute the
following command on the target host:
	  pminfo -f network.interface.total.packets
the (double) quoted instance names are the required network interface
names.
This is most useful to remove the loopback, SLIP and PPP interfaces
from the rule evaluations.";
