QA archives that are dynamically created.

These archives are used to exercise pmlogger and the other tools
that create archives, and as such they are not checked into the
git tree.

This includes the archive families foo, bar, bigbin, interp, gap and
dodgey, along with some variants (truncbin and reduce-gap) and the
multivolume (mv-*) variants and the no index (noti-*) variants.

The archives here will tend to persist ... they are made once from
the QA ../check script using the "make setup" target.  To clean up
and force the archives to be recreated you can:

	$ make clean; make setup

See also ../archives for the static QA archives.
