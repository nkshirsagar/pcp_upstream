simple.color
Help:
This metric has 3 instances, designated "red", "green" and "blue".

The value of the metric is monotonic increasing in the range 0 to
255, then back to 0.  The different instances have different starting
values, namely 0 (red), 100 (green) and 200 (blue).

The metric values my be altered using pmstore(1).

simple.now
Help:
The value reflects the current time of day through a dynamically
reconfigurable instance domain.  On each metric value fetch request,
the agent checks to see whether the configuration file in
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/simple.conf has been modified - if it has then
the file is re-parsed and the instance domain for this metric is again
constructed according to its contents.

This configuration file contains a single line of comma-separated time
tokens from this set:
  "sec"  (seconds after the minute),
  "min"  (minutes after the hour),
  "hour" (hour since midnight).

An example configuration file could be:  sec,min,hour
and in this case the simple.now metric would export values
for the three instances "sec", "min" and "hour" corresponding
respectively to the components seconds, minutes and hours of the
current time of day.

The instance domain reflects each token present in the file, and the
values reflect the time at which the PMDA processes the fetch.

simple.numfetch
Help:
The cumulative number of pmFetch operations directed to the "simple"
PMDA.

This counter may be modified with pmstore(1).

simple.time.sys
Help:
The time in seconds that the CPU has spent executing system code for
the agent.

simple.time.user
Help:
The time in seconds that the CPU has spent executing user code for the
agent.
