Record Mode
===========

Phase A:
[ ] Check running pmlogger processes (ps auw | grep pmlogger)
[ ] Open one CPU View for localhost and a second CPU view for
    a remote host, click Record -> Start -> OK
[ ] Verify red light comes on and Record menu items are:
    enabled (Query/Stop/Detach) and disabled (Start)
[ ] Click Record -> Query, check contents of 2 pmlogger popups
[ ] Click Record -> Stop, check contents of 2 pmlogger popups.

    push button in bottom left corner, in pmtime select Options
    -> Boundaries and verify the time window matches up with
    the timeframe recorded.
[ ] Fast forward through the archive, then Fast Back to start,
    checking the charts for both hosts matches expectations.
[ ] Verify no additional pmlogger processes are running.
[ ] Run: pmafm ~/.pcp/pmlogger/[timenow].folio replay
    Verify a pmchart starts up with appropriate archive view
    of CPU utilisation for both hosts.

Phase B:
[ ] Check running pmlogger processes (ps auw | grep pmlogger)
[ ] Open one CPU View for localhost and a second CPU view for
    a remote host, click Record -> Start -> OK
[ ] Verify red light comes on and Record menu items are:
    enabled (Query/Stop/Detach) and disabled (Start)
[ ] Click Record -> Detach, check contents of 2 pmlogger popups.

Phase C:
[ ] Open a Disk View for localhost, click Record -> Start
[ ] Verify only valid double precision numbers can be entered
    as the time interval, try: abc, 1.1.1, 12.a4, -1 (all bad)
[ ] Set the time units to minutes and the interval to 0.001.
[ ] Push folio button, set folio to "/tmp/folio" from popup
[ ] Push logfile button, try set log to "/tmp" from popup
    (verify this isn't possible), then "/var/tmp/pmlogger.log"
    from the popup.
[ ] Push archive button, set name to "/tmp/archive/record"
[ ] Click OK
[ ] Leave run for a few seconds, then click Record -> Stop
[ ] Run: pmdumplog -l /tmp/archive/record
    Verify the output matches the time recorded
[ ] Run: pminfo -a /tmp/archive/record
    Verify the output lists several kernel.all.cpu metrics,
    and three pmcd.pmlogger metrics.
[ ] Run: pmafm /tmp/folio replay
    Verify a pmchart starts up with appropriate archive view
[ ] Run: rm -fr /tmp/archive /var/tmp/pmlogger.log /tmp/folio
