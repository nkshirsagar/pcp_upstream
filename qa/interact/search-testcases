Search Dialog for Metric Selection
==================================

[ ] Start pmchart, click on New Chart from the File Menu Item or Toolbar
    Verify that the Search icon (magnifying glass) is enabled on
    the central menu bar
    Click the Search icon
    The Metric Seach dialog should appear with
    - Metric Name Pattern empty
    - Instance Name Pattern empty
    - Clear and Cancel buttons enabled
    - Select All, Search and OK buttons disabled

[ ] In the Metric Name Pattern input field, enter sample.bi
    Note that Search is enabled at the first keystroke (s)
    Excute the search via each of the following
    - Enter
    - click Search
    - type Alt-S
    Results should always be the same ... sample.bigid and the 9 instances
    of the sample.bin metric

[ ] Test the selection behaviour for the matched metrics
    - Select All button
    - Click (select one, deselect all others)
    - Shift-click (select a range to last click)
    - Ctl-click (toggle single item selection)

[ ] Select All then Ctl-click sample.bin[bin-500], then click OK
    Expect 9 metrics to be selected in the New Chart dialog, and the Available
    Metrics tree to be expanded at the [-]-- sample and [-]-- bin nodes

[ ] Return to the Metric Search dialog.
    Expect the previous state to be preserved - Metric Name Pattern is
    sample.bi, 10 matching results and 9 selected results, all buttons enabled

[ ] Click Clear
    Should revert to the initial state
    - Metric Name Pattern empty
    - Instance Name Pattern empty
    - Clear and Cancel buttons enabled
    - Select All, Search and OK buttons disabled

[ ] Go to the New Chart dialog,
    - in live mode, select disk.all.read and select all of the instances
      for network.interface.total.packets.
    - in archive mode, select sample.bigid and all of the instances for
      pmcd.pmlogger.port
    Click the search icon to open the Search Metric dialog.
    The New Chart dialog should be unchanged and insensitive (Search
    Metric is modal).

[ ] In the Instance Name Pattern, enter ^bin-[0-5]..$ then click Search.
    Expect 40 matches for the instance names bin-100 to bin-500 for the
    8 metrics (.bin .bogus_bin .bucket and .part_bin for the sample and
    sampledso pmdas)
    In the Metric Name Pattern, enter b.*_bin then click Search.
    Expect just 10 matches for the .bogus_bin metrics in the sample and
    sampledso pmdas.

[ ] Click Select All, then click OK.
    Back in the New Chart dialog, click the Insert plot into button
    and verify that all of metrics appear in the chart
    - disk.all.read (or sample.bigid)
    - all the instances of network.interface.total.packets (or
      pmcd.pmlogger.port)
    - instances bin-100 thru bin-500 for sample.bogus_bin
    - instances bin-100 thru bin-500 for dsosample.bogus_bin

[ ] Repeat all of the above for archive mode, starting pmchart as
    follows:
    Run:	$ pmchart -a pcp-gui/qa/archives/viewqa1
    There are no sampledso metrics in this archive, so the set of
    matching metrics will typically be halved compared to the live
    tests.
