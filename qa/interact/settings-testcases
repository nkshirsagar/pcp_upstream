Global Settings
===============

Sampling

[ ] Open the Settings dialog.  This is available from the Edit
    menu (Linux) or from the pmchart Preferences menu on a Mac.
[ ] Type some invalid chart intervals into the one-line editor
    (try: abc, 0.1.1, -1 - none should be possible)
[ ] Set the chart interval to zero and press OK - should block
    this with an error dialog.

[ ] Type some invalid logger intervals into the one-line editor
    (try: 0XY, 1.0.2, -1 - none should be possible)
[ ] Set the logger interval to zero and press OK - should block
    this with an error dialog.

[ ] Set default logger interval to 20 minutes
    Change units to Milliseconds; value should be:   1,200,000 
    Change units to Seconds;      value should be:       1,200
    Change units to Minutes;      value should be:          20
    Change units to Hours;        value should be:    0.333333
    Change units to Days;         value should be:    0.138888
    Change units to Weeks;        value should be:    0.001984
[ ] Set default chart interval to 0.25 seconds	
    Change units to Milliseconds; value should be:         250
    Change units to Seconds;      value should be:        0.25
    Change units to Minutes;      value should be:    0.004166
    Change units to Hours;        value should be:    0.000069
    Change units to Days;         value should be:    0.000002
    Change units to Weeks;        value should be:    0.000000
    Change units to Seconds; reset value to 0.25 seconds
[ ] Move the sample history and visible history sliders - they
    should never allow visible history to become less than the
    sample history, and neither is ever allowed to become less
    than 2.
[ ] Check that only numeric values can be entered into each of
    the visible and simple history spin boxes - check range of
    values is again 2 -> maximum (360 at the moment).
[ ] Check that the spin box Up/Down arrows increase/decrease
    each value by 1, and that PageUp/PageDown increase/decrease
    each value by 10 - check the range of values is again 2 ->
    the maximum, for all of Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown.
[ ] Set sample history size to 4
[ ] Set visible history size to 2
[ ] Press OK, exit pmchart, restart pmchart, bring up Settings
    dialog and verify the following values are set...
    ( ) Default Chart Interval:  0.25 seconds
    ( ) Default Record Interval: 1200 seconds
    ( ) Default Visible Points:  2
    ( ) Default Sample Count:    4


Colors

[ ] Open the Settings Dialog, click on the Colors tab.
[ ] Click the Selected Chart Highlight button, select a different
    colour (hot pink), and click OK.  Verify that the push button
    changes colour to your selection.
[ ] Click the Canvas Background button, select a different colour
    (white), and click OK.  Verify that the push button changes
    colour to your selection.
[ ] Click on one of the existing Default plot colours and select a
    different colour.  Verify the new colour is displayed for that
    button.
[ ] Click on any three of the white (empty) color buttons and make
    a colour selection for each.  Any three buttons - gaps in the
    set are fine, and testing extremes (next free slot, last free)
    is a good idea too).
[ ] Push the OK button to accept your changes.
[ ] Open the QA View "qa/views/RotateColors", and expand the window
    the full height of your screen .  Also open the Settings dialog
    again at the colors page, and verify that the colors have been
    used for each plot in the View in the order listed on the page.
[ ] Verify also that the Settings dialog is displaying the colours
    you selected before, but with no spaces between colours now -
    i.e. with any unused (white) "gap" buttons removed.
[ ] Finally, verify that the plot after the final colour specified
    originally in the Settings dialog has rotated back to the first
    colour, the next has rotated back to the second colour, etc.


Toolbar

[ ] Open the Settings Dialog, click on the Toolbar tab.
[ ] Uncheck the "Show Toolbar on Startup" check box.
[ ] Select "Right and Vertical" from the Location/Orientation box.
[ ] Quit pmchart.  Restart pmchart.  Verify that the Toolbar is not
    displayed at all.  Verify also that the Toolbar option from the
    Options menu is not checked.
[ ] Select the Toolbar item in the Options menu.  Verify that the
    toolbar is now displayed on the right of the main charting area
    instead of across the top of the main window.
[ ] Open the Settings dialog once more, verifying that the "Show
    Toolbar on Startup" option is not checked and that the Location/
    Orientation combo box shows Right/Vertical.
[ ] Make a series of selections from the Actions list (items are
    selected and deselected simply by clicking on them).  Press the
    OK button and verify that the main window is updated to display
    your selected actions, instead of the defaults.
[ ] Exit pmchart.  Restart pmchart.  Verify that your selected set of
    actions is still displayed, in preference to the defaults.
