Opening and Saving Views
========================

Live Open

[ ] Start pmchart, click on Open View in the File Menu Item or Toolbar
    Verify that the initial view displays the System views (CPU, Disk,
    Loadavg, NFS, etc).  All View names should be fully visible with a
    (light blue folder) View icon associated with each.
[ ] Resize the window, down to its minimum size and up to a larger size
    than the initial window.  Verify the child widget layout remains as
    sensible as possible for the window size.
[ ] Before selecting anything click on the Open push button, and verify
    that a warning dialog is displayed (No views specified) and that
    the Open View dialog remains on screen.

[ ] Verify the filesystem traversal functionality - select your home
    directory from the Path combo box.  The list of displayed files
    should be updated to match, and the System View toolbutton (top-
    right corner) should no longer be selected.
[ ] Click on the Parent toolbutton (arrow icon, just right of the Path
    combo box), and verify this traverses to the parent directory).
    Check that the Path combo box is updated each time to show the new
    full path.  Repeat clicking it until the root directory is reached.
[ ] Click on the Path combo box, all directories visited should be in
    the list.
[ ] Select your home directory from the Path combo box again.  Now walk
    to the root of the filesystem by entering the parent directory (..)
    into the File text box.

[ ] Click on the Host combo box.  At this stage it should just show the
    local QA host name.  Click on the Add Host push button, to the right
    of the Host combo box.  Enter an invalid name, e.g. no.such.host in
    the Add Host dialog.  Verify that the error is reported and that the
    dialog stays on-screen.  Press Cancel.
[ ] Click the Add Host button once more, and this time enter a valid
    remote hostname.  Click OK, and then verify that the Host combobox
    now displays two hosts, with the newly added host first in the list
    (and selected as the default host now).
    **Note: the host used next should be the local (not remote) QA host:
[ ] Switch (back) to the local QA host in the Host combo box.  Click
    on the CPU and Disk view icons (need Ctrl+Click, for multi-select)
    then click on the Open button.  Verify that these views are indeed
    opened in the main pmchart window (should have CPU/Disk metrics,
    legend on, auto-scale for Disk view, 100% utilisation view for CPU).

Live Save

[ ] Select the Save View option from the File menu.  
[ ] Resize the window, down to its minimum size and up to a larger size

    directory from the Path combo box.  The list of displayed files

    warning message is displayed saying that file exists; press Cancel.

    "LiteralQA" in the file text box, and press the Save button.
[ ] Create a new tab - click the New Tab tool button on the main window,
    then enter the Label "Dynamic QA", ensure Live Host radio button is
