Export and Print
================

Export

[ ] Run: pmchart -a archives/chartqa1 -c views/ScaleManual
[ ] Verify that the default image format (png) is show, the default file
    name is $HOME/chart.png, and that the Width/Height are 302/280 pixels
    respectively.
[ ] Shift the quality slider up/down - check that the value is updated in
    the Quality spin box.  Check the reverse also - that the slider moves
    when values are entered via the Quality spin box controls.
[ ] Enter the following parameters:
    - Image format: jpeg (make sure that the file extension changes)
    - Transparent background disabled
    - Filename /tmp/qa1.jpeg
    - All Charts in Tab enabled
    and Press OK.
[ ] Verify using an image editor (eog, gimp, xv, ...) that a jpeg image
    matching the main pmchart window is generated in that file.
[ ] Select the second (bottom) chart in the main window, then open the
    Export dialog once again.
[ ] The previous settings should all have been preserved.  Enable the
    transparent background option, and click the Selected Chart Only
    toggle button.  When you click that button, the Width/Heigth should
    be updated to 302/151 pixels.  Modify those values to 300/150 pixels.
    Change the format to png (check the filename extension is updated),
    and press OK.
[ ] Verify with your image viewing tool that a transparent background
    png format image with only the selected chart has been generated,
    and that it has dimensions 300/150 pixels.
[ ] Open the Export dialog once again, and press OK.  You should see a
    dialog prompting you whether you want to overwrite the existing
    /tmp/qa1.png file.  Click cancel, and cancel in the export dialog.


Print

[ ] Open the Print Dialog, click on Print to File, and enter the
    file name "/tmp/qa2.pdf".
[ ] Set paper Orientation to Landscape.
[ ] Set paper Format to B5.
[ ] Press Print, and verify that the file generated displays both of
    the charts and matches the above printing parameters, using a pdf
    viewing tool (xpdf, gnome-viewer, ...)

[ ] Open the Print Dialog, click on Print to File, and enter the
    file name "/tmp/qa3.pdf".
[ ] Set paper Orientation to Portrait.
[ ] Set paper Format to A4.
[ ] Press Print, and verify that the file generated matches these
    parameters, using your pdf viewing tool, and shows both graphs.

[ ] If you have a printer connected, send a job to the printer instead
    of to a file, and verify it once more (print parameters will now
    depend on your printer and available paper).
