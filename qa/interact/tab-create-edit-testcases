Creating and Editing Tabs
=========================

Live Edit

[ ] Run: pmchart -t 0.5 -c CPU -c Disk
[ ] Select Start from the Record menu.  Press OK to start recording.
[ ] Click on Edit Tab in the Edit Menu, to bring up the default live
    mode tab details.
    Verify that the Live Hosts button is checked, the displayed Label
    matches the original Tab ("Live") and the default sample ranges
    are displayed correctly in both sliders and spin boxes (should be
    60 Visible and 180 Total Samples).  Verify also that it is not
    possible to modify the Live/Archive radio button selection.
[ ] Modify the Total samples using both the spinbox and the slider to
    increase and decrease its value.  Verify that the Total Samples
    value cannot be reduced below the Visible Samples value, and that
    neither can be reduced below 2.  Modify the Visible Samples value
    using both methods.  Verify that its value cannot be increased
    beyond the Total Samples value.
[ ] Verify the minimum and maximum ranges of both Visible and Total
    Samples - currently this is 2 to 360.
[ ] Press Cancel.

[ ] Click on the Zoom In button (from the Toolbar or Edit menu)
    repeatedly.  Verify that the number of visible points decreases
    down to the minimum (2 samples) and that the toolbar and menu
    actions become disabled at that point.
[ ] Click on the Zoom Out button repeatedly.  Verify that the number
    of visible points increases up to the maximum (360 samples), that
    the Zoom In action becomes enabled after the first press, and that
    the Zoom Out action is disabled once the maximum is reached.
[ ] Zoom In three clicks, then expose the Edit Tab dialog.  The Visible
    Samples should be 252, and the Total Samples should still be 360.
[ ] Resize the Edit Tab window, down to its minimum size and up to a
    larger size than the initial window.  Verify the child widget layout
    remains as sensible as possible for the window size.
[ ] Change the Label to "LiveQA", set Visible points to 120 and press OK.
    Verify that the changes are made to the current pmchart Live tab.

Live Create

[ ] Click on the Create Tab chart from the Edit menu or toolbar.
    Check the Live Hosts radio button, set the Label to "LiveQA2", set
    Visible points to 12 and Total points to 24.  Press OK.  Verify that
    a new Live Tab is created with each of those parameters (use Edit
    Tab dialog to verify the total/visible points setting).
[ ] Open the CPU and Disk views in the new Tab.  Verify that they start
    to display data matching the same charts in the original Live tab.
[ ] Select Close Tab from the File menu.

Archive Create

[ ] Select Stop from the Record menu.
[ ] Verify that a new Archive Tab is created named "Record".
[ ] Click on the new tab and verify that it is of archive type, has a
    sensible time axis, and is displaying the same CPU/Disk views as
    the original Live tab.
[ ] Click on the archive time control button, and verify that the Bounds
    dialog in the Time Controls matches the length of time you recorded.

Archive Edit

[ ] Click on the Edit Tab dialog for the new Archive Tab.  Verify that
    it displays the Archive radio button as checked (and not editable),
    that the samples settings match the original Live Tab.
[ ] Modify the Label to be "RecordQA" and press OK.
[ ] Click on the Zoom In and Zoom Out toolbar buttons a few times and
    verify that nothing unexpected happens.
