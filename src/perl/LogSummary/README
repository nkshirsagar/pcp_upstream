PCP-LogSummary version 1.00
===========================

The PCP::LogSummary module is a wrapper around the PCP pmlogsummary(1)
command.  Its primary purpose is to automate the production of post-
processed pmlogsummary data, in particular to automate the step where
the summarised data is imported into a spreadsheet for further anaylsis.
This has proven to often be an iterative process - when done manually
it involves much cutting+pasting and can be a significant time waster.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no other Perl modules and libraries, but does
obviously require a working Performance Co-Pilot installation.
