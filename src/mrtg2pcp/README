Converting a mrtg log file to a PCP archive

This example uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper around the libpcp_import
library to convert a sadc datafile into a PCP archive.

Usage: mrtg2pcp hostname devname timezone mrtglogfile archive

The translation currently supports the following PCP metrics:
    network.interface.in.bytes
    network.interface.out.bytes

This is sufficient to support the following standard pmchart views:
    Netbytes
