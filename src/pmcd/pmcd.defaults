# Environment variables for the pmcd daemon.  Refer also to the
# pmcd.options and pmcd.conf files for additional configuration.

# Behaviour regarding listening on external-facing interfaces;
# unset PMCD_LOCAL to allow connections from remote hosts.
# A value of 0 permits remote connections, 1 permits local only.
# PMCD_LOCAL=1

# Max length to which the queue of pending connections may grow
# A value of 5 is the default.
# PMCD_MAXPENDING=5

# Default behaviour regarding pmcd's approach to staring pmdas;
# In cases where pmdaroot is available, setting this variable to
# 1, offloads starting and stopping of agents to pmdaroot.  This
# allows pmcd to not require a restart when starting a new pmda.
PMCD_ROOT_AGENT=1
