# These functions use chkconfig if available, else tolerate missing chkconfig
# command (as on SUSE) by manipulating symlinks in /etc/rc.d directly.
#
# Usage:
#
# is_chkconfig_on : return 0 if $1 is chkconfig "on" else 1
# chkconfig_on    : chkconfig $1 "on"
# chkconfig_off   : chkconfig $1 "off"
# chkconfig_on_msg: echo a message about how to chkconfig $1 on
#

#
# Return 0 if $1 is chkconfig "on" (enabled) at the current run level
# Handles missing chkconfig command and other assorted atrocities.
#
is_chkconfig_on()
{
    return 0
}

#
# chkconfig "on" $1
# Handles missing chkconfig command.
# (this is used by the pcp rpm %post script)
#
chkconfig_on()
{
    :
}

#
# chkconfig "off" $1
# Handles missing chkconfig command.
# (this is used by the pcp rpm %preun script)
#
chkconfig_off()
{
    :
}

#
# Echo a message about how to chkconfig $1 "on"
# Tolerates missing chkconfig command
