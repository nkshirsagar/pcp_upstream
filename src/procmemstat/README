procmemstat - a sample client using the PMAPI
=============================================

procmemstat is a sample client that uses the Performance Metrics
Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to report its own memory
use.

The source is shipped as part of pcp.sw.demo and is installed in
/var/pcp/demos/procmemstat.  If you have the C compiler installed, the
source and Makefile in this directory may be used to create a
functionally equivalent binary, simply by entering the command

	% make

The source in procmemstat.c demonstrates most of the PMAPI services, and
may be used as a template and style guide when creating your own PMAPI
clients.  Note in particular, the use of ./pmnsmap.spec and the shipped
tool pmgenmap to assist in the creation of arguments to the PMAPI
routines, and the manipulation of PMAPI data structures.
