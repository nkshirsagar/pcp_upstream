sample pcp_mmv applications
===========================

acme.c
 is a sample application that is instrumented with the pcp_mmv
interface to generate metrics available from the MMV PMDA
(Performance Metrics Domain Agent).  It runs without exiting,
and continually updates the mmv.acme.* metric values.  Detailed
discussion about the workings of this application and each of
the instrumentation API calls it uses, is available as part of
the "Performance Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide".

mmvdump.c
 an example program that dumps the contents of a (memory mapped)
mmv(5) format file, as created by the pcp_mmv library and read by
the MMV PMDA.  The binary is also shipped as part of pcp and can
be found installed below ${PCP_PMDAS_DIR}/mmv.


All source is shipped as part of pcp as well and is installed in
${PCP_DEMOS_DIR}/mmv.  If you have a C toolchain installed, the
sources and Makefile in this directory may be used to create the
functionally equivalent binaries, by entering the command

	% make acme mmvdump
