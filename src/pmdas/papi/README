Papi PMDA
=========

This PMDA exports Performance API (PAPI) eventsets related to memory
usage and instruction statistics.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list
all the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

    $ pminfo -fT papi

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

        # ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

    If you choose the "default" installation, appropriate values will
    be assigned to those parameters that control the customiztion of
    the PMDA.  Otherwise consult the pmdapapi(1) man page for a
    descript of the customiztion parameters.

Removal
=======

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/papi.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
