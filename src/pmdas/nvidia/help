@ nvidia.numcards Number of Graphics Cards
The number of NVIDIA Graphics cards installed in this system

@ nvidia.gpuid GPU ID
Zero indexed id of this NVIDIA card

@ nvidia.cardname GPU Name
The name of the graphics card

@ nvidia.busid Card Bus ID
The Bus ID as reported by the NVIDIA tools, not lspci

@ nvidia.temp The temperature of the card
The Temperature of the GPU on the NVIDIA card in degrees celcius.

@ nvidia.fanspeed Fanspeed
Speed of the GPU fan as a percentage of the maximum

@ nvidia.perfstate NVIDIA performance state
The PX performance state as reported from NVML.  Value is an integer
which should range from 0 (maximum performance) to 15 (minimum).  If
the state is unknown the reported value will be 32, however.

@ nvidia.gpuactive Percentage of GPU utilization
Percentage of time over the past sample period during which one or more
kernels was executing on the GPU.

@ nvidia.memactive Percentage of time spent accessing memory
Percent of time over the past sample period during which global (device)
memory was being read or written.  This metric shows if the memory is
actively being accesed, and is not correlated to storage amount used.

@ nvidia.memused Allocated FB memory
Amount of GPU FB memory that has currently been allocated, in bytes.
Note that the driver/GPU always sets aside a small amount of memory
for bookkeeping. 

@ nvidia.memtotal Total FB memory available
The total amount of GPU FB memory available on the card, in bytes.

@ nvidia.memfree Unallocated FB memory
Amount of GPU FB memory that is not currently allocated, in bytes.
