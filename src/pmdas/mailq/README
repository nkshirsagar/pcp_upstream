Mailq PMDA
==========

This PMDA exports information about the sendmail(1) queue.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT mailq

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain defined
    in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mailq.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
