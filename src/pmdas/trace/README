Trace PMDA
==========

This PMDA exports application-level transaction and event statistics.

The PMDA needs to be used in conjunction with the pcp_trace library,
which provides the pmtracebegin, pmtraceend, pmtracepoint, ... functions
to user-level programs.

For information about the use of the pcp_trace dynamic library and its
function call interface, see pmdatrace(1) and pmdatrace(3).  Also, the
example programs - $PCP_VAR_DIR/demos/trace/*.c are useful as starting
points.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT trace

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

    If you choose the "default" installation, appropriate values will
    be assigned to those parameters that control the customization of
    the PMDA.  Otherwise consult the pmdatrace(1) man page for a
    description of the customization parameters.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trace.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
