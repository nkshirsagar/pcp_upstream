@ web.config.numservers number of servers in configuration file
The number of Web servers specified in the configuration file.
The log files for these Web servers may or may not be monitored,
see web.perserver.watched and web.allservers.numwatched.

@ web.config.catchup maximum time (secs) before Web server logs are probed
The time in seconds after which monitored Web server logs will be
examined, even if there have been no requests for performance metrics
from those logs.  The "catch up" process spreads the load and minimizes
the latency at the first requests for metrics that have not been
requested for a long time.

This metric has the initial value of the -t delay option to
pmdaweblog, and may be altered using pmStore(1).

@ web.config.catchuptime time (secs) to perform catchup
Accumulated elapsed time in which the Web logs PMDA has been performing
the "catch up" process to examine all Web server logs.

@ web.config.check time (secs) after which stationary logs will be re-opened 
Web server log files that are not changing are periodically closed and
re-opened to detect possible log file rotation.  This metric controls
how often a stationary log file will be re-opened.

This metric has the initial value of the -n idlesec option to
pmdaweblog, and may be altered using pmStore(1).
