Performance Co-Pilot PMDA for Monitoring CIFS Shares
====================================================

This PMDA is capable of collecting statistics from CIFS shares mounted
on the local system.

The PMDA collects its data through the /proc/fs/cifs/Stats file as long
as the CIFS kernel module is loaded into the kernel.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics which are
exposed by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all of
the available metrics and their explanatory “help” text:

    + # $ pminfo -fT cifs

Installation
============

    + # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs

    + Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
      defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDA's currently in use (see
      $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH). If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
      domain number.

    + Then simply use

        # ./Install

 	and choose both the “collector” and “monitor” installation
        configuration options.

        followed by choosing to install either as a "daemon" or "dso"
        agent.

De-Installation
===============

    + Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs
        #./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

    + After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
      ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
      ($PCP_LOG_DIR/PMCD/cifs.log) should be checked for any warnings or
      errors.

    + In an event where no values are being returned for most of the 
      metrics check ensure that the cifs kernel module is loaded on
      the system, for the full set of metrics to return values make
      sure that at least one CIFS share is also mounted on the system.

          $ modprobe cifs

          $ pminfo -f cifs
