Systemd PMDA
===========

This PMDA exports events from the systemd journal [1] as they occur.
There is no configuration required.  In the default (daemon) PMDA
mode, the daemon switches to userid 'adm', so it can report systemwide
journal entries.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT systemd

The interesting metrics are systemd.journal.records and
systemd.journal.records_raw.  When a PCP client such as pmevent
monitors them, each new journal entry is reported as a PCP event
tuple.  Each field of the journal entry is transcribed as a string or
blob, including the FIELDNAME= prefix.  See [2] for more details about
interpretation of the fields.

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options -- everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/systemd.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
