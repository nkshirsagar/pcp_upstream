@ CISCO.1 Interfaces on Cisco router
There is one instance in this domain for each interface on a Cisco router
that the Cisco PMDA (Performance Metrics Domain Agent) has been told about
when the PMDA is started.

The names of the instances are of the form hostname:tX where "t" is one of
"a" for ATM, "B" for ISDN BRI, "e" for Ethernet, "E" (FastEthernet), "f" for
Fddi, "h" for HSSC, "s" for Serial or "Vl" for Vlan.  The "X" is the
interface identifier which is either an integer (e.g. 4000 Series routers) or
two integers separated by a slash (e.g. 7000 Series routers) or three
integers separated by a slash and a period (Frame-Relay PVCs on serial line
subinterfaces).

@ cisco.bytes_in Total Kbytes input to the Cisco
Total number of Kbytes input to the Cisco on this interface.

Note that due to network delays in extracting the metrics from the
Cisco routers, any rate computed from this metric over small deltas in time
are likely to be subject to wide variance.

@ cisco.bytes_out Total Kbytes output from the Cisco
Total number of Kbytes output from the Cisco on this interface.

Note that due to network delays in extracting the metrics from the
Cisco routers, any rate computed from this metric over small deltas in time
are likely to be subject to wide variance.

@ cisco.bytes_out_bcast Total broadcast Kbytes output from the Cisco
Total number of broadcast Kbytes output from the Cisco on this interface.

Note that due to network delays in extracting the metrics from the
Cisco routers, any rate computed from this metric over small deltas in
time are likely to be subject to wide variance.

@ cisco.rate_in 5 minutes average input rate in bytes (not bits!) per second
Cisco's computed average input rate in bytes per second, over the recent
past, for this interface.

@ cisco.rate_out 5 minutes average output rate in bytes (not bits!) per second
Cisco's computed average output rate in bytes per second, over the recent
past, for this interface.

@ cisco.bandwidth peak interface bandwidth in bytes per second
