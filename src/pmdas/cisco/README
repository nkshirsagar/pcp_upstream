Performance Co-Pilot PMDA for Monitoring Cisco Routers
======================================================

This PMDA is capable of collecting throughput measures from Cisco
routers throughout a network.

The PMDA needs to be configured to collect performance data from a
designated set of interfaces on nominated Cisco routers.  There is one
instance of the metrics for nominated each router-interface pair.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT cisco

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  The Cisco PMDA is one that polls the Cisco routers, and caches the
    most recent value for the performance metrics.  The cached values
    are the ones returned via the PMCD to clients requesting Cisco
    performance metrics.  The default polling rate is once every two
    minutes to each Cisco interface being monitored, if you wish to
    change this, edit Install and change the value of pollrate near the
    start of the script.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

    You will be prompted to identify the Cisco routers and
    interfaces you wish to monitor.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/cisco.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.

 +  The configured interfaces on a particular Cisco may be discovered
    using the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/probe application.  See pmdacisco(1)
    for more details.

 +  The $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco/parse application supports the same
    command line options as pmdacisco for identifying interfaces on
    Cisco devices and shares the parser for the output from the Cisco
    "show interface" command; this application may be used to gain
    diagnostic traces of the interaction between the parser code and
    the Cisco device in the event that metrics values are not being
    returned by the Cisco PMDA.  See pmdacisco(1) for more details.
