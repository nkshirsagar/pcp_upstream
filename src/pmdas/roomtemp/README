Roomtemp PMDA
=============

This PMDA exports the temperature from one or more sensors built using
the DS2480 and DS1280 chipsets and MicroLAN (aka 1-Wire) technology
from Dallas Semiconductor Corporation.  See http://www.dalsemi.com/

You'll need the following hardware:

DS2480	Serial 1-Wire Line Driver
	http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/2480.pdf

	Not needed if you obtain one of the integrated packages like the
	DS9097U.

DS9097U	Universal 1-Wire COM Port Adapter
	http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/9097u.pdf

	This includes the DS2480 and I have the DS9097U-S09 variant that
	is a standard DB-9 female package.

DS1820	1-Wire Digital Thermometer
	http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/1820.pdf

After you've got at least one DS9097U and one DS1820 you'll need a
spare serial port on the host running PMCD, a soldering iron and some
cable (telco or similar) with an RJ-11 male plug attached at one end.

Use the ./probe application to exercise all of the hardware before
you try and install the PMDA.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT roomtemp

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/roomtemp.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
