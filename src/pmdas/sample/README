Sample PMDA
===========

This PMDA supports a synthetic collection of metrics that are designed
to exercise various facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot.  The most
common reasons for installing this PMDA are
    a. for internal product QA, or
    b. as part of one of the animated tutorials or demonstrations that
       accompany the PCP

Two variants of the PMDA are installed, namely "sample" as a daemon
with an IPC channel to PMCD, and "sampledso" that is attached as a
Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) by PMCD and called directly.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT sample sampledso

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

    Note that sampledso uses the next domain number after the one in
    ./domain.h, so you must check for its uniqueness as well.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

    You will be prompted to choose the IPC channel for the daemon
    implementation of the sample PMDA -- everything else is automated

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sample.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
