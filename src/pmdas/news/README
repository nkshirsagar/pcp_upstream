Usenet News PMDA
================

This PMDA is a sample, that illustrates how a simple PMDA might be
constructed using the Perl PMDA API.

Although the metrics supported are simple, the framework in the script
pmdanews is quite general, and could be re-used to implement other
PMDAs.

Metrics
=======

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT news

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/news

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

 +  By default the script pmdanews operates on a small test-case copy a
    news "active" file, installed from here into
    $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/news/active.  If you wish to use a more realistic base
    of Usenet data, edit pmdanews.pl to make it use your "live active"
    groups, then

	# ./Install.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/news
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/news.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
