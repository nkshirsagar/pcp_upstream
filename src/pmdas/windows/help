@ network.interface.speed interface speed in megabytes per second
The linespeed on the network interface, as reported by the kernel,
scaled from Megabits/second to Megabytes/second.

@ network.interface.baudrate interface speed in bytes per second
The linespeed on the network interface, as reported by the kernel,
scaled from bits/second and divided by 8 to convert to bytes/second.
See also network.interface.speed for the Megabytes/second value.

@ pmda.uname identity and type of current system
